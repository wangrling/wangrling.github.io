            [Verse 1]
            <br> Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
            <br> Welcome to the final show
            <br> Hope you're wearing your best clothes<br> You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky<br> You look pretty good down here<br> But you ain't really good<br>
            <br> [Pre-Chorus]
            <br> We never learn, we been here before<br> Why are we always stuck and running from<br> The bullets? The bullets?<br> We never learn, we been here before<br> Why are we always stuck and running from<br> The bullets? The bullets?<br>
            <br> [Chorus]
            <br> Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times<br> We gotta get away from here<br> We gotta get away from here<br> Just stop your crying, it'll be alright<br> They told me that the end is near<br> We gotta get away from here<br>
            <br> [Verse 2]<br> Just stop your crying, have the time of your life<br> Breaking through the atmosphere<br> And things are pretty good from here<br> Remember everything will be alright<br> We can meet again somewhere<br> Somewhere far away from here<br>
            <br> [Pre-Chorus]
            <br> We never learn, we been here before<br> Why are we always stuck and running from<br> The bullets? The bullets?<br> We never learn, we been here before<br> Why are we always stuck and running from<br> The bullets? The bullets?<br>
            <br> [Chorus]
            <br> Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times<br> We gotta get away from here<br> We gotta get away from here<br> Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright<br> They told me that the end is near<br> We gotta get away from here<br>
            <br> [Pre-Chorus]
            <br> We never learn, we been here before<br> Why are we always stuck and running from<br> The bullets? The bullets?<br> We never learn, we been here before<br> Why are we always stuck and running from<br> The bullets? The bullets?<br>
            <br> [Bridge]
            <br> We don't talk enough, we should open up<br> Before it's all too much<br> Will we ever learn? We've been here before<br> It's just what we know<br>
            <br> [Outro]
            <br> Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times<br> We gotta get away, we got to get away<br> We got to get away, we got to get away<br> We got to get away<br> We got to, we got to, away<br> We got to, we got to, away<br> We got to, we got to, away<br>

            <font color="#FF000">Don't Cry --- Guns N' Roses</font>
        </h3>
        <p>Don't Cry由Axl Rose和Izzy Stradlin在1986年洛杉矶创作。<br>Axl曾描述这首歌为“一个女人离开心爱的人”。这个女孩曾经是Stradlin喜欢的，Axl也被她的魅力所吸引。Axl很喜欢这个女孩，但是一个女人不能同时喜欢两个男人，所以这深深地伤害了他的内心，激励他写了这首歌。</p>
